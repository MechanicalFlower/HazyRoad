## About

Ever had one of those days where even getting home feels like a puzzle? Well, that's exactly what happens in __Hazy Road__. You're cruising home, and bam! A barrier shows up out of nowhere, blocking your way. So, you do what any sane person would do – step out of your car and figure out how to get the heck out of this crossroads mess.

Explore and interact with object to figure out how to unblock your way at the crossroads.

### Controls

Keep it simple and straight:

- <kbd>W</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd>: Move around, just like in real life.
- <kbd>Mouse</kbd>: Look around, because that's what you'd do.
- <kbd>Shift</kbd>: Speed things up with a good old sprint.
- <kbd>Space</kbd>: Jump – because life's full of unexpected obstacles.
- <kbd>ESC</kbd>: Press this when you need a breather, to fiddle with settings or take a break.

It's not the fanciest game, but hey, neither is life. So, go on, tackle that crossroads puzzle, and let's see if you've got what it takes to outsmart a stubborn barrier. Good luck!
